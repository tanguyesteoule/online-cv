    title: About me
    summary: |
      My name is Tanguy Esteoule, I currently work as a Data Scientist in the company [meteo*swift](https://www.meteoswift.fr/en/), specialized in artificial intelligence in the field of energy transition.
      My work focuses specifically on wind power forecasting. In particular, I study the consideration of interdependencies and interactions between wind turbines for forecasting.

      I did my Ph.D., _Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems for Wind Power Forecasting_, in the [SMAC team](https://www.irit.fr/smac/) at IRIT, computer science laboratory in Toulouse, France.

      I am naturally curious and I have always been passionate about music.
